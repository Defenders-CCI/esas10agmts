Description: Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the US Endangered Species Act is how
    non-federal entities - private landowners, state governments, and others -
    receive authorization to 'take' listed species, or coverage for certain types
    of activities involving candidate species, in return for taking conservation
    actions for those species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) keeps
    basic records about these agreements on their ECOS website, \url{http://
    ecos.fws.gov}. This data.frame was created by scraping the ECOS pages for all
    listed, candidate, and proposed species and extracting the summary tables for
    all section 10 agreements. The types of agreements in the data include: Habitat
    Conservation Plans (HCPs); Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs); Candidate Conservation
    Agreements (CCAs); and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances
    (CCAAs).
