## Endangered Species Act Section 10 Agreements

Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the US Endangered Species Act is how non-federal entities - private landowners, state governments, and others - receive authorization to 'take' listed species, or coverage for certain types of activities involving candidate species, in return for taking conservation actions for those species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) keeps basic records about these agreements on their ECOS website, \url{http://ecos.fws.gov}. This data.frame was created by scraping the ECOS pages for all listed, candidate, and proposed species and extracting the summary tables for all section 10 agreements. The types of agreements in the data include: Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs); Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs); Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCAs); and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAAs). This data was collected in early June, 2016, and will be updated as time and resources allow.
